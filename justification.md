 My overall approach of tackling this project was to do every part a little bit at once and figure out my way as I go. This approach isn't the most effective, and I found that having a solid base diagram and understanding of how my game will work is necessary. While constructing the classes, I found that building the GamePlay at the same time helped with understanding what methods I would need and not need. 

 From this project, I learned how that it is not legal in Java to have 2D arrays of data type ArrayList. I also learned about the importance of giving clear directions of the game and what users can do. Initially, I had little instructions, and I found adding descriptions like "Press enter to continue" makes the game easier to play for users.

 I received lots of helpful feedback from different people that helped me build the game and make it more engaging. F
